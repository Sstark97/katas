# Roman Numerals
The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete
and straight roads and even bikinis [1]. One thing they never discovered though was the number zero. This made writing 
and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with 
is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programmes.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are 
hence easy to hack into stone tablets)

## Part One
The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg
- 1 --> I
- 10 --> X
- 7 --> VII

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any 
higher)

## Part Two
Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit
