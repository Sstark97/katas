# Katas 🥷🏻
In this repository, all the katas/coding dojos that I have done are grouped together, with some solutions being 
different or using different programming languages.
The goal is to have all the solutions I have worked on grouped together, see different approaches to the same problem, 
and be able to compare them.

## Structure ⚙️
The repository, in turn, contains different projects for each kata, each organized by the different programming languages 
I have used. The directory structure is as follows:
```
katas
├── kata1
│   ├── first_language
│   ├── second_language
│   ├── third_language
├── kata2
│   ├── first_language
│   ├── second_language
│   ├── ...
├── kata3
```
In each of the programming language directories, there is a README.md file with the kata's description.
