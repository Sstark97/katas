# String Calculator
This classic kata guides you step by step through the implementation of a calculator that receives a String as input. 
It is a good exercise on refactoring and incremental implementation. It is also a good candidate for practising TDD.

## First Step
Create a function add that takes a String and returns a String:
- The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma, and returns their sum.
- An empty string will return “0”.
- Example of inputs: "", "1", "1.1,2.2".
